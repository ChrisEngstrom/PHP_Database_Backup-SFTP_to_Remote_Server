Backup Script v1.0

Script made by Chris Engstrom
    Purpose: Create a backup of each of our databases individually and
             save them to the server via a cron job to be downloaded at
             a later date.

    Updates needed for v2.0
        Install the libssh2 library on the server and implement the sftp
        for this script.

    Crontab entry for later reference:
        0 4 * * * nice -n 15 /usr/local/bin/php /usr/www/users/USER/PATH_TO_FILE/database_backup-tempsol.php
